ðŸ“Œ Project Brief â€“ OrderExpress - Vendor Inventory & Ordering Platform (MVP)
ðŸŽ¯ Goal
Build a multi-user web application that allows businesses (bars, restaurants, clubs, etc.) to manage alcohol & other inventory, track stock, and send weekly order emails to vendor representatives.
The MVP should allow:
â€¢	Businesses to create accounts.
â€¢	Admins to invite team members with role-based permissions.
â€¢	Staff to update inventory and add vendor details.
â€¢	Automatic weekly email generation to vendors.
________________________________________
ðŸ›  Tech Stack
â€¢	Frontend: React (Create React App template with TypeScript + Tailwind CSS for styling)
â€¢	Backend: Supabase (Auth, Database, Role-based Access)
â€¢	Email: Supabase Functions or external service (e.g. Resend / SendGrid)
â€¢	Deployment: Vercel (Frontend), Supabase Cloud (Backend)
________________________________________
ðŸ”‘ Core Features (MVP)
1. Authentication & Accounts
â€¢	User sign up / login with Supabase Auth.
â€¢	Email + password login (social login optional, not MVP).
â€¢	Business account creation (a user can create a business).
â€¢	Role-based access:
o	Admin â€“ manage users, vendors, and inventory.
o	Manager â€“ manage inventory and vendors but cannot remove Admins.
o	Staff â€“ update inventory only.
________________________________________
2. Business & User Management
â€¢	Each business has its own workspace (multi-tenant setup).
â€¢	Admin can invite users by email to join the business account.
â€¢	Role assignment on invite.
â€¢	Users can belong to multiple businesses (future-proofing, optional MVP).
________________________________________
3. Vendors & Reps
â€¢	Business users manually add vendor details (name, category, rep contact info, email).
â€¢	No external vendor database â€“ everything is user-input.
â€¢	Vendors are tied to a business account.
________________________________________
4. Inventory Management
â€¢	Businesses can create and manage an inventory list of alcohol and other products.
â€¢	Fields: Item name, category, quantity in stock, reorder threshold, vendor link.
â€¢	Inventory updates by any permitted user (role-based).
â€¢	Simple UI for adding, editing, and deleting items.
________________________________________
5. Ordering System
â€¢	Generate weekly orders automatically:
o	Pull items below reorder threshold.
o	Compile per vendor.
â€¢	Send order email to vendor rep automatically once a week.
â€¢	Business admin can review/edit order before sending.
________________________________________
ðŸ“Š Database Schema (Supabase)
Tables (initial draft):
â€¢	users (managed by Supabase Auth)
â€¢	businesses (id, name, created_by)
â€¢	user_business_roles (user_id, business_id, role)
â€¢	vendors (id, business_id, name, contact_name, email)
â€¢	inventory_items (id, business_id, name, category, quantity, reorder_threshold, vendor_id)
â€¢	orders (id, business_id, vendor_id, created_at, status)
â€¢	order_items (order_id, inventory_item_id, quantity)
________________________________________
ðŸš€ Development Roadmap (MVP)
1.	Setup & Boilerplate
o	CRA + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
o	Supabase connection (auth + database)
2.	Auth & Business Setup
o	User registration & login
o	Business creation
o	Invite users to business (email link, role assignment)
3.	Vendor Management
o	Add/edit/delete vendor reps
o	Store contact info + email
4.	Inventory System
o	Add/edit/delete items
o	Link items to vendors
o	Track stock + reorder thresholds
5.	Ordering & Emails
o	Generate weekly order drafts
o	Admin approval before sending
o	Send emails via Supabase function or Resend
6.	UI Polish
o	Clean, minimal UI for managing data
o	Role-based UI (hide actions user isnâ€™t allowed)

âœ… With this brief, youâ€™ll be able to copy it into Cursor, and it will have full context of features + Supabase integration + MVP scope.
Do you want me to also write the first supabase schema migration (SQL) for you so you can plug it in right away and have the tables ready?
